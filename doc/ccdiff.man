       --utf-8 -U
         All I/O (streams to compare and standard out) are in UTF-8.

       --unified[=3] -u [3]
         Generate a unified diff. The number of context lines is optional.
         When omitted it defaults to 3. Currently there is no provision of
         dealing with overlapping diff chunks. If the common part between two
         diff chunks is shorter than twice the number of context lines, some
         lines may show twice.

         The default is to use traditional diff:

       --verbose[=1] -v[1]
         Show an additional line for each old or new section in a change chunk
         (not for added or deleted lines) that shows the hexadecimal value of
         each character. If "--utf-8" is in effect, it will show the Unicode
         character name(s).

         This is a debugging option, so invisible characters can still be
         "seen".

         "--verbose" accepts an optional verbosity-level. On level 2 and up,
         all horizontal changes get left-and-right markers inserted to enable
         seeing the location of the ZERO WIDTH or invisible characters. With
         level 3 and up and Unicode enabled, the changed characters will also
         show the codepoint in hex.

         An example of this:

         With -Uu0v0:

          1,1c1,1
          - A  BCDE Fg
          + A BcdEXFg

         With -Uu0v1:

          1,1c1,1
          - A  BCDE Fg
          - -- verbose : SPACE, LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C, LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D, SPACE
          + A BcdEXFg
          + -- verbose : LATIN SMALL LETTER C, LATIN SMALL LETTER D, ZERO WIDTH SPACE

         With -Uu0v2:

          1,1c1,1
          - A X XBXCDXEX XFg
          - -- verbose : SPACE, LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C, LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D, SPACE
          + A BXcdXEXXXFg
          + -- verbose : LATIN SMALL LETTER C, LATIN SMALL LETTER D, ZERO WIDTH SPACE

         With -Uu0v3:

          1,1c1,1
          - A X XBXCDXEX XFg
          - -- verbose : SPACE (U+000020), LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C (U+000043), LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D (U+000044), SPACE (U+000020)
          + A BXcdXEXXXFg
          + -- verbose : LATIN SMALL LETTER C (U+000063), LATIN SMALL LETTER D (U+000064), ZERO WIDTH SPACE (U+00200B)

         With -Uu0v2 --ascii:

          1,1c1,1
          - A > <B>CD<E> <Fg
          - -- verbose : SPACE, LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C, LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D, SPACE
          + A B>cd<E>X<Fg
          + -- verbose : LATIN SMALL LETTER C, LATIN SMALL LETTER D, ZERO WIDTH SPACE

         the word "verbose" and the character markers will be displayed using
         the "verbose" color. The characters used for the markers can be
         defined in your configuration file as "chr_cml" (the character used
         as marker on the left) and "chr_cmr" (the character used as marker on
         the right).

       --markers -m
         Use markers under each changed character in change-chunks.

         "--markers" is especially useful if the terminal does not support
         colors, or if you want to copy/paste the output to (ASCII) mail. See
         also "--ascii". The markers will have the same color as added or
         deleted text.

         This will look like (with unified diff):

          5,5c5,5
          -Sat Dec 18 07:08:33 1998,I.O.D.U.,,756194433,1442539
          -               X       X
          +Sat Dec 18 07:00:33 1993,I.O.D.U.,,756194433,1442539
          +               X       X

         The characters used for the markers can be defined in your
         configuration file as "chr_old" (the character used as marker under
         removed characters) and "chr_new" (the character used as marker under
         added characters).

         If "--ellipsis" is also in effect and either the "chr_eli" is longer
         than one character or "--verbose" level is over 2, this options is
         automatically disabled.

       --ascii -a
         Use (colored) ASCII indicators instead of Unicode. The default
         indicators are Unicode characters that stand out better. The markers
         will have the same color as added or deleted text.

         For the vertical markers ("-m") that would look like:

          5,5c5,5
          -Sat Dec 18 07:08:33 1998,I.O.D.U.,,756194433,1442539
          -               ^       ^
          +Sat Dec 18 07:00:33 1993,I.O.D.U.,,756194433,1442539
          +               ^       ^

         For the positional indicators, I did consider using U+034e (COMBINING
         UPWARDS ARROW BELOW), but as most terminals are probably unable to
         show it due to line height changes, I did not pursue the idea.

       --pink -p
         Change the default "red" for deleted text to the color closest to
         pink that is supported by Term::ANSIColor: "magenta".

       --reverse -r
         Reverse/invert the foreground and background for the colored
         indicators.

         If the foreground color has "bold", it will be stripped from the new
         background color.

       --swap -s
         Swap the colors for new and old.

       --list-colors
         List available colors and exit.

       --no-colors
         Disable all colors. Useful for redirecting the diff output to a file
         that is to be included in documentation.

         This is the default if the environment variable $NO_COLOR has a true
         value or if the environment variable $CLICOLOR is set to a false
         value.  If set, $CLICOLOR_FORCE will overrule the default of
         $NO_COLOR.

       --old=color
         Define the foreground color for deleted text.

       --new=color
         Define the foreground color for added text.

       --bg=color
         Define the background color for changed text.

       --index --idx -I
         Prefix position indicators with an index.

          [001] 5,5c5,5
          -Sat Dec 18 07:08:33 1998,I.O.D.U.,,756194433,1442539
          +Sat Dec 18 07:00:33 1993,I.O.D.U.,,756194433,1442539

         If a positive number is passed ("--index=4" or "-I 4"), display just
         the chunk with that index, using the "verbose" color:

         This is useful in combination with "--verbose".

       --threshold=2 -t 2
         Defines the number of lines a change block may differ before the
         fall-back of horizontal diff to vertical diff.

         If a chunk describes a change, and the number of lines in the
         original block has less or more lines than the new block and that
         difference exceeds this threshold, "ccdiff" will fall-back to
         vertical diff.

       --heuristics=n -h n
         Defines the percentage of character-changes a change block may differ
         before the fall-back of horizontal diff to vertical diff.

         This percentage is calculated as "(characters removed + characters
         added) / (2 * characters unchanged))".

       --ellipsis=n -e n
         Defines the number of characters to keep on each side of a
         horizontal-equal segment. The default is 0, meaning do not compress.

         If set to a positive number, and the length of a segment of equal
         characters inside a horizontal diff is longer than twice this value,
         the middle part is replaced with "X U02508 \N{BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT
         QUADRUPLE DASH HORIZONTAL}" (instead of X U02026, as HORIZONTAL
         ELLIPSIS does not stand out enough).

         With "-u0me3" that would be like

          5,5c5,5
          -SatX07:08:33X 1998,I.X539
          -        X        X
          +SatX07:00:33X 1993,I.X539
          +        X        X

         With "-u0e3 -v2" like

          5,5c5,5
          -SatX9X07:0X0X:33 199X3X,I.X23X539
          - -- verbose : DIGIT ZERO, DIGIT THREE
          +SatX9X07:0X8X:33 199X8X,I.X23X539
          + -- verbose : DIGIT EIGHT, DIGIT EIGHT

         The text used for the replaced text can be defined in your
         configuration file as "chr_eli" and/or "chr_eli_v".

       --ignore-case -i
         Ignore case on comparison.

       --ignore-all-space -w
         Ignore all white-space changes. This will set all options "-b", "-Z",
         "-E", and "-B".

       --ignore-trailing-space -Z
         Ignore changes in trailing white-space (TAB's and spaces).

       --ignore-ws|ignore-space-change -b
         Ignore changes in horizontal white-space (TAB's and spaces). This
         does not include white-space changes that splits non-white-space or
         removes white-space between two non-white-space elements.

   [1mConfiguration files[0m
       In order to be able to overrule the defaults set in "ccdiff", one can
       set options specific for this login. The following option files are
       looked for in this order:

        - $HOME/ccdiff.rc
        - $HOME/.ccdiffrc
        - $HOME/.config/ccdiff

       and evaluated in that order. Any options specified in a file later in
       that chain will overwrite previously set options.

       Option files are only read and evaluated if it is not empty and not
       writable by others than the owner.

       The syntax of the file is one option per line. where leading and
       trailing white-space is ignored. If that line then starts with one of
       the options listed below, followed by optional white-space followed by
       either an "=" or a ":", followed by optional white-space and the
       values, the value is assigned to the option. The values "no" and
       "false" (case insensitive) are aliases for 0. The values "yes" and
       "true" are aliases to "-1" ("-1" being a true value).

       Between parens is the corresponding command-line option.

       unified (-u)
         If you prefer unified-diff over old-style diff by default, set this
         to the desired number of context lines:

          unified : 3

         The default is undefined

       markers (-m)
          markers : false

         Defines if markers should be used under changed characters. The
         default is to use colors only. The "-m" command line option will
         toggle the option when set from a configuration file.

       ascii (-a)
          ascii   : false

         Defines to use ASCII markers instead of Unicode markers. The default
         is to use Unicode markers.

       reverse (-r)
          reverse : false

         Defines if changes are displayed as foreground-color over background-
         color or background-color over foreground-color. The default is
         "false", so it will color the changes with the appropriate color
         ("new" or "old") over the default background color.

       swap (-s)
          reverse : false

         Swap the colors for new and old.

       new (--new)
          new     : green

         Defines the color to be used for added text. The default is "green".

         The color "none" is also accepted and disables this color.

         Any color accepted by Term::ANSIColor is allowed. Any other color
         will result in a warning. This option can include "bold" either as
         prefix or as suffix.

         This option may also be specified as

          new-color
          new_color
          new-colour
          new_colour

       old (--old)
          old     : red

         Defines the color to be used for delete text. The default is "red".

         The color "none" is also accepted and disables this color.

         Any color accepted by Term::ANSIColor is allowed. Any other color
         will result in a warning. This option can include "bold" either as
         prefix or as suffix.

         This option may also be specified as

          old-color
          old_color
          old-colour
          old_colour

       bg (--bg)
          bg      : white

         Defines the color to be used as background for changed text. The
         default is "white".

         The color "none" is also accepted and disables this color.

         Any color accepted by Term::ANSIColor is allowed. Any other color
         will result in a warning. The "bold" attribute is not allowed.

         This option may also be specified as

          bg-color

       header (-H --header --HC=color --header-color=color)
          header  : 1
          header  : blue_on_white

         Defines if a header is displayed above the diff (default is 1),
         supported colors are allowed.

         If the values is a valid supported color, it will show the header in
         that color scheme.  To disable the header set it to 0 in the RC file
         or use "--no-header" as a command line argument.

       verbose
          verbose : cyan

         Defines the color to be used as color for the verbose tag. The
         default is "cyan". This color will only be used under "--verbose".

         The color "none" is also accepted and disables this color.

         Any color accepted by Term::ANSIColor is allowed. Any other color
         will result in a warning.

         This option may also be specified as

          verbose-color
          verbose_color
          verbose-colour
          verbose_colour

       utf8 (-U)
          utf8    : yes

         Defines whether all I/O is to be interpreted as UTF-8. The default is
         "no".

         This option may also be specified as

          unicode
          utf
          utf-8

       index (-I)
          index   : no

         Defines if the position indication for a change chunk is prefixed
         with an index number. The default is "no". The index is 1-based.

         Without this option, the position indication would be like

          5,5c5,5
          19,19d18
          42a42,42

         with this option, it would be

          [001] 5,5c5,5
          [002] 19,19d18
          [005] 42a42,42

         When this option contains a positive integer, "ccdiff" will only show
         diff the diff chunk with that index.

       emacs
          emacs   : no

         If this option is yes/true, calling "ccdiff" with just one single
         argument, and that argument being an existing file, the arguments
         will act as

          $ ccdiff file~ file

         if file~ exists.

       threshold (-t)
          threshold : 2

         Defines the number of lines a change block may differ before the
         fall-back of horizontal diff to vertical diff.

       heuristics (-h)
          heuristics : 40

         Defines the percentage of character-changes a change block may differ
         before the fall-back of horizontal diff to vertical diff. The default
         is undefined, meaning no fallback based on heuristics.

       ellipsis (-e)
          ellipsis : 0

         Defines the number of characters to keep on each side of a
         horizontal-equal segment. The default is 0, meaning to not compress.
         See also "chr_eli".

       chr_old
          chr_old : U+25BC

         Defines the character used to indicate the position of removed text
         on the line below the text when option "-m" is in effect.

       chr_new
          chr_new : U+25B2

         Defines the character used to indicate the position of added text on
         the line below the text when option "-m" is in effect.

       chr_cml
          chr_cml : U+21B1

         Defines the character used to indicate the starting position of
         changed text in a line when verbose level is 3 and up.

       chr_cmr
          chr_cmr : U+21B0

         Defines the character used to indicate the ending position of changed
         text in a line when verbose level is 3 and up.

       chr_eli
          chr_eli : U+21B0

         Defines the character used to indicate omitted text in large
         unchanged text when "--ellipsis"/"-e" is in effect.

         This character is not equally well visible on all terminals or in all
         fonts, so you might want to chane it to something that stands out
         better in you environment. Possible suggestions:

         When ussing "--ellipsis" with "--verbose" level 2 or up, the single
         character indicator will be replaced with this character. If it is 2
         characters wide, the length of the compressed part is put between the
         characters.

         A suggested alternative might be U+21E4U+21E5

       You can use ccdiff to show diffs in git. It may work like this:

        $ git config --global diff.tool ccdiff
        $ git config --global difftool.prompt false
        $ git config --global difftool.ccdiff.cmd 'ccdiff --utf-8 -u -r $LOCAL $REMOTE'
        $ git difftool SHA~..SHA
        $ wget https://github.com/Tux/App-ccdiff/blob/master/Files/git-ccdiff \
           -O ~/bin/git-ccdiff
        $ perl -pi -e 's{/pro/bin/perl}{/usr/bin/env perl}' ~/bin/git-ccdiff
        $ chmod 755 ~/bin/git-ccdiff
        $ git ccdiff SHA

       Of course you can use "curl" instead of "wget" and you can choose your
       own (fixed) path to "perl" instead of using "/usr/bin/env".

       From then on you can do

        $ git ccdiff
        $ git ccdiff 5c5a39f2

[1mCAVEATS[0m
       Due to the implementation, where both sides of the comparison are
       completely kept in memory, this tool might not be able to deal with
       (very) large datasets.

   [1mSpeed[0m
       There are situations where Algorithm::Diff takes considerable more time
       compared to e.g. GNU diff. Installing Algorithm::Diff::XS will make
       "ccdiff" a lot faster. "ccdiff" will choose Algorithm::Diff::XS if
       available.
